## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m Padmashree, a tech enthusiast blending creativity with code. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning as part of my Master of Computer Applications, building on a solid foundation from my Bachelorâ€™s in Commerce with Computer Applications.

I love solving real-world problems with Python, Java, and a full stack of web technologiesâ€”think HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React.js, Node.js, and more! Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB are my playgrounds. My recent projects, such as [e-plantShopping](https://github.com/Padmashree1203/e-plantShopping) and [oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai](https://github.com/Padmashree1203/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai), showcase my hands-on experience in building smart and user-friendly solutions.

Iâ€™m passionate about data visualization and machine learning, always eager to learn cutting-edge tools and collaborate in innovative teams. Whether itâ€™s a hackathon, a group project, or a new tech trend, Iâ€™m ready to jump in and contribute!

Outside of code, youâ€™ll find me singing, playing the violin, sketching, or on the court playing badminton, kabaddi, or volleyball. I believe that creativity fuels technologyâ€”and vice versa.

Letâ€™s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spadmashree) if youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s as enthusiastic about technology as they are about life. Iâ€™m open to learning opportunities and excited to bring my energy to real-world projects!
