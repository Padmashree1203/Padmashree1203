# Hi there 👋 I'm Padmashree  

**Aspiring AI & ML Professional | MCA Student | Full-Stack Developer**

## 👩‍💻 About Me  

Hi! I’m **Padmashree**, a tech enthusiast blending creativity with code.  
Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)** with a specialization in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, building on a solid foundation from my **Bachelor’s in Commerce with Computer Applications**.  

I love solving real-world problems with **Python, Java, and a full stack of web technologies**. Databases like **MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MongoDB** are my playgrounds.  

My recent projects, such as:  
- 🌱 [**e-plantShopping**](https://github.com/Padmashree1203/e-plantShopping)  
- 🤖 [**oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai**](https://github.com/Padmashree1203/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai)  

…showcase my hands-on experience in building smart and user-friendly solutions.  

Outside of code, you’ll find me **singing, playing the violin, sketching, or on the court playing badminton, kabaddi, or volleyball**.  
I believe that **creativity fuels technology—and vice versa.**  

Let’s connect on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spadmashree) if you’re looking for someone who’s as enthusiastic about technology as they are about life.
